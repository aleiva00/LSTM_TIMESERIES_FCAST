# Results and Final Remarks

* Converting the time series forecasting problem to a supervised learning problem involves a different data preparation.
* Despite varying the training, validation, and test dates, the model consistently exhibits low errors.
* The model is complex to understand and build, but especially challenging to explain. This represents a significant obstacle for its application in daily practice, where accountability to third parties may be necessary.
* Something good to do if more time is available: fine-tuning with hyperparameters (e.g., grid search, etc.).
* This model **has limited scope for more everyday problems**; forecasting the exchange rate for the next day may be of little use to most people. Despite this limitation, this practical exercise, which is restricted by time, **serves as a solid foundation** for adding complexity, steps, and generating forecasts over a longer time horizon.
