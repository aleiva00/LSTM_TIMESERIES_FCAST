# ML_Final_Project
This repo houses my final project for a machine learning course at TEC de Costa Rica. Titled 'Time Series Forecasting with LSTM Model' it showcases how to solve a forecasting problem for time series with recurrent neural networks. Although time-constrained, it offers a primer for more sophisticated models. This is joint work with Cristian Cubero.



# Table of Contents

- [1. What is LSTM](<Documentation/1. What is LSTM.md>): high level explanation and examples.
- [2. Preprocessing](Documentation/2. Pre-processing.md): handling missing values and building a rectangular matrix for next steps.
- [3. Time series to supervised learning problem](<Documentation/3. Time series to supervised learning problem.md>): transform lags into features.
- [4. Building the model](<Documentation/4. Building the model.md>): get the data ready, split into train, val and test, build the model, train it and see what happens.
- [5- Results and final remarks](<Documentation/5. Results and final remarks.md>): couple lessons from this flash project.
