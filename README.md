# ML_Final_Project
This repo houses my final project for a machine learning course at TEC de Costa Rica. Titled 'Forecasting Exchange Rates with Multivariate Neural Networks,' it showcases how to solve a forecasting problem for time series with recurrent neural networks. Although time-constrained, it offers a primer for more sophisticated models.
